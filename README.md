Hello,

This is going to be my first mock up of a website. It will be a mock up of the google frontpage.

After I've completed this project I've shown I'm able to do the following:

 - Insert a logo
 - Insert a text field
 - Insert buttons
 - Insert a navigation bar
 - Set it all up nicely (This will probably be the hardest)

 After I've managed to complete the "easy" project, I'll see if I can manage with the difficult project, which is setting up the google result page.

 We'll see how it goes. Wish me luck.
